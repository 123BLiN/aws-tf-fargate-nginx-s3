# Endpoints currently do not support cross-region requestsâ€”ensure that you create your 
# endpoint in the same region as your bucket. You can find the location of your bucket 
# by using the Amazon S3 console, or by using the get-bucket-location command. 
# Use a region-specific Amazon S3 endpoint to access your bucket; 
# for example, mybucket.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com.
